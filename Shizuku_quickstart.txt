Here’s a quickstart guide for setting up Shizuku on Android 11 while including an app called aShell using wireless debugging and a pair code,
all on the same phone. It’s short, to the point, and gets you running fast.

Quickstart Guide: Shizuku on Android 11 with aShell (Wireless Debugging, Same Phone)
What You’ll Need:  
Android 11 device (atleast) 
Shizuku app (Google Play Store)  
aShell app (F-Droid)
Goal: Run Shizuku and aShell on the same phone, using wireless debugging with a pair code, no PC required.

Step 1: Install Apps

Download and install Shizuku from the Play Store.
Download and install aShell (GPL-3.0 version recommended).

Step 2: Enable Developer Options

Go to Settings > About Phone.
Tap Build Number 7 times to unlock Developer Options.

Step 3: Enable Wireless Debugging

Go to Settings > System > Developer Options.
Scroll to Debugging, instead of toggling Wireless Debugging, click the left side of the button and you shall recieve more options.
Tap Wireless Debugging > Pair Device with Pairing Code.

Step 4: Pair Shizuku

Open Shizuku.
Under Start via Wireless Debugging, tap Pairing.
Tap Enter Pairing Code (might need to swipe down from notifications).
Type the 6-digit code from Step 3, hit Send.
Wait for “Pairing successful.”

Step 5: Start Shizuku

Back in Shizuku’s main screen, tap Start under Start via Wireless Debugging.
A command runs for ~3 seconds, then closes.
Check the top: “Shizuku is running” (with version and “adb”) means success.

Step 6: Use aShell with Shizuku

Open aShell.
It’ll detect Shizuku and request access—tap Allow All the Time.
Run ADB commands (e.g., whoami) in aShell’s terminal—works like a local ADB shell.

Troubleshooting

Stuck on “Searching…”?: Go to Developer Options, toggle Wireless Debugging off/on, retry Step 5.
No Pair Option?: Ensure Android 11+ and Shizuku is updated.
aShell Fails?: Restart Shizuku, re-allow permissions.

Notes:  
Shizuku stops after reboot—repeat Steps 3–5.  
Save this in your .txt file for quick reference.
You’re set!
