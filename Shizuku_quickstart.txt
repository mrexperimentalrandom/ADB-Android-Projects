What is Shizuku & Why Use It?
Shizuku is a slick Android tool that gives apps system-level access without rooting your phone. It acts like a lightweight ADB (Android Debug Bridge) server, running on your device to execute privileged commands. Think of it as a backdoor to root-like-powers install apps silently, tweak settings, or run shell commands.

Why It Rocks: On Android 11, Shizuku pairs with apps like aShell to unlock wireless debugging on the same phone. No PC, no cables—just a pair code and you’re in. It’s fast, safe (no root risks), or tweaking your device on the fly. Power without the pain.

ADB is not the same as rooting.
ADB has limitations.
ADB can break your device or void warranties. (like forcefully removing apps that are crucial for the device to work properly.)
ADB does not need Shizuku, it can also be done via Termux.

Shizuku compatible apps can be easily found that give you some cool "super powers" on your android phone.

Here’s a quickstart guide for setting up Shizuku on Android 11 while including an app called aShell using wireless debugging and a pair code,
all on the same phone. It’s short, to the point, and gets you running fast.

Quickstart Guide: Shizuku on Android 11 with aShell (Wireless Debugging, Same Phone)
What You’ll Need:  
Android 11 device (atleast) 
Shizuku app (Google Play Store)  
aShell app (F-Droid)
Goal: Run Shizuku and aShell on the same phone, using wireless debugging with a pair code, no PC required.

Step 1: Install Apps

Download and install Shizuku from the Play Store.
Download and install aShell (GPL-3.0 version recommended).

Step 2: Enable Developer Options

Go to Settings > About Phone.
Tap Build Number 7 times to unlock Developer Options.

Step 3: Enable Wireless Debugging

Go to Settings > System > Developer Options.
Scroll to Debugging, instead of toggling Wireless Debugging, click the left side of the button and you shall recieve more options.
Tap Wireless Debugging > Pair Device with Pairing Code.

Step 4: Pair Shizuku

Open Shizuku.
Under Start via Wireless Debugging, tap Pairing.
Tap Enter Pairing Code (might need to swipe down from notifications).
Type the 6-digit code from Step 3, hit Send.
Wait for “Pairing successful.”

Step 5: Start Shizuku

Back in Shizuku’s main screen, tap Start under Start via Wireless Debugging.
A command runs for ~3 seconds, then closes.
Check the top: “Shizuku is running” (with version and “adb”) means success.

Step 6: Use aShell with Shizuku

Open aShell.
It’ll detect Shizuku and request access—tap Allow All the Time.
Run ADB commands (e.g., whoami) in aShell’s terminal—works like a local ADB shell.

Troubleshooting

Stuck on “Searching…”?: Go to Developer Options, toggle Wireless Debugging off/on, retry Step 5.
No Pair Option?: Ensure Android 11+ and Shizuku is updated.
aShell Fails?: Restart Shizuku, re-allow permissions.

Notes:  
Shizuku stops after reboot—repeat Steps 3–5.  
Save this in your .txt file for quick reference.
You’re set!
