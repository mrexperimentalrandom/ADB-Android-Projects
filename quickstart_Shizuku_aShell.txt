Given that you have Shizuku already set up and running, here's how you can connect to your Galaxy Watch 4 from aShell on your Android device:

    Open aShell: Launch the aShell app on your Android device.
    Forward ADB Connection:
        In aShell, type the following command to forward the ADB connection to your watch:
        bash

        shizuku -c "adb forward tcp:5555 tcp:<watch_ip>:<watch_port>"

        Replace <watch_ip> and <watch_port> with the IP address and port of your Galaxy Watch 4 that you noted from the Wireless debugging settings.
    Connect to Your Watch:
        After forwarding, connect to your watch by running:
        bash

        adb connect localhost:5555

    Verify Connection:
        To confirm the connection, type:
        bash

        adb devices

        Your watch should appear in the list.


This process uses Shizuku #playstore to run the ADB command with the necessary permissions to forward the connection, allowing you to interact with your Galaxy Watch 4 directly from aShell #fdroid on your Android device.
This is the easiest way, in my opinion. You can also just use Termux.
